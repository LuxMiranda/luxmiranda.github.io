  <p>Hi there!</p>

  <p>I'm a graduate assistant at the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory at the University of Central Florida, a new sister lab to the <a href="https://complexity.cecs.ucf.edu/">Complex Adaptive Systems Laboratory</a>.</p>

  <p>I want to help turn AI into a force for social good in a field where scholars and engineers so often disregard the social consequences of the technologies they create. I believe that by marrying social science with computer science, we can both make better AI and garner a better understanding of our society, our technologies, and ourselves. With this comes the understanding of how we can transform our society into a more sustainable, equitable, and compassionate place for everyone.</p>

  <p>My research interests to this end are broad and range from work in fundamental theoretics to immediate real-world applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    I've helped <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80387-2_32">robots understand human intent</a> so that we can get along with them a little bit better.</li>
  <li>I've analyzed the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232609">evolution of entire cultures over millennia</a> to get a better grip on how these "society" things of ours grow and change in the long-run.</li>
  <li>A project I helped lead is now <a href="https://www.usu.edu/today/story/utah-space-university-gas-teams-satellite-successfully-deployed-from-iss">in low Earth orbit</a> (though that one was just for fun).</li>
  <li>I helped create (and currently co-steward) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01118-7">the worlds most complete dataset of archaeological radiocarbon dates</a> so that we can better understand what did and didn't work for our ancestors.</li>
  <li>My master's thesis is about <a href="https://youtu.be/Z7zmaHVSHdc">using AI to understand the social factors that help foster sustainable irrigation systems</a>.</li>
</ul>

Feel free to get in touch with me via any of the means listed on this website!
