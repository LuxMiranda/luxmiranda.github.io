  <p>Hello!</p>

  <p>I'm a class-of-2020 undergraduate at Utah State University double-majoring in Computational Mathematics and Computer Science and minoring in Anthropology.</p>

  <p>I'm interested in using mathematical and computational techniques to help answer big questions about human societies and how they evolve. With a background in space engineering, I'm also particularly interested in researching the social structures and practices that will best sustain human settlements in space and on other worlds.</p>

  <p>Feel free to email me at <strong>lux (dot) miranda (at) usu (dot) edu</strong>.</p>
