  <p>Hello!</p>

  <p>I'm a class-of-2020 undergraduate at Utah State University double-majoring in Computational Mathematics and Computer Science and minoring in Anthropology.</p>

  <p>I'm interested in using mathematical and computational techniques to help answer big questions about human societies and how they evolve. With a background in space engineering, I'm also particularly interested in researching the social structures and practices that will best sustain human settlements in space and on other worlds.</p>

  <p>Feel free to check out some of the pinned projects on my GitHub or email me at <img src="images/email.png" style="height: 1.2em;" alt="jack dot miranda at aggie mail dot usu dot edu" /> </p>
