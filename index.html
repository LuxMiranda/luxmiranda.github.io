  <p>Hi, I'm Lux (like the SI unit for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux">lumens per square metre</a>)! </p>

  <p>I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://usr-lab.github.io/">Uppsala Social Robotics Laboratory</a> in Sweden.</p>

    <p>Ethical AI that is aligned to human values has tremendous potential to remedy existential dangers and transform our Earth—and any other place we choose to inhabit—into a more sustainable, equitable, and compassionate place for everyone. My mission, in a broad sense, is to see this through.</p>

    <p> With a background drawing from complexity science, anthropology, space engineering, cognitive science, and computational modeling, my current work is focused on the ethics and diversification of robot identity and mind/body spaces, AI alignment, and the dynamics of social intelligence. </p>

  <p>Some other things I've worked on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My master's thesis was on <a href="https://stars.library.ucf.edu/etd2020/1054/">getting AI to understand the social factors that foster human cooperation</a>.</li>
  <li>I've analyzed the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232609">evolution of entire cultures over millennia</a> to get a better grip on how these society things of ours grow and change in the long-run.</li>
  <li>A project I helped lead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GASPACS">went to space</a> (though that one was just for practice).</li>
  <li>I helped create (and currently steward) <a href="https://www.p3k14c.org/">the world's most complete dataset of archaeological radiocarbon dates</a> so that we can better understand how to care for our own society by understanding what did and didn't work for the societies of our ancestors.</li>
</ul>
