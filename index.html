  <p>Hi, I'm Lux (like the SI unit for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux">lumens per square metre</a>)! </p>

  <p>I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://usr-lab.github.io/">Uppsala Social Robotics Laboratory</a> in Sweden.</p>

  <p>If we can make AI one with our true needs, we might be able to wield it against social and existential threats and reshape our Earth—and anywhere else we choose to make home—to be more sustainable, fair, and kind for everyone. I seek to help see this through.</p>

    <p> In addition to contemporary AI and machine learning, my background draws from complexity science, anthropology, space engineering, mathematics, and philosophy. My current work is focused on the human impact and ethics of robot identity, norm-sensitive human-robot interaction, and AI alignment. </p>

    <p>Please see my <a href="/publications/">publications</a> for my most recent work.</p>

    <p>Feel free to get in touch with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}">Twitter</a> or via <a href="/contact/">email!</a></p>
