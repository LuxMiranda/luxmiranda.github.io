  <p>Hi there!</p>

  <p>I'm a graduate assistant at the <a href="https://complexity.cecs.ucf.edu/">Complex Adaptive Systems Laboratory at the University of Central Florida</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm interested in using quantitative means to help answer big questions about human societies, organizations, and cultures. With a background in space engineering, I'm also particularly interested in understanding the social structures and practices that will best sustain human settlements in space and on other worlds.</p>
