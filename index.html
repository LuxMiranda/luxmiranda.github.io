  <p>Hi there!</p>

  <p>I'm a graduate assistant at the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory at the University of Central Florida, a new sister lab to the <a href="https://complexity.cecs.ucf.edu/">Complex Adaptive Systems Laboratory</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm interested in using computational means to help answer big questions about human societies, organizations, teams, and cultures. With a background in space engineering, I'm also particularly interested in understanding the social structures and practices that will best sustain human settlements in space and on other worlds.</p>
  
  <p>I believe that by developing and leveraging advances in computing, we can better understand the behavior of human beings. Through this understanding, we can transform our society into a more sustainable, equitable, and compassionate place for everyone.</p>
