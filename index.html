  <p>Hi, I'm Lux (like the SI unit for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux">lumens per square metre</a>! </p>

  <p>I'm a <a href="https://pibbss.ai">PIBBSS fellow</a> and a PhD student at the <a href="https://usr-lab.github.io/">Uppsala Social Robotics Laboratory</a> in Sweden. My current work is focused on the ethics of robot identity construction and feminist robot design.</p>

  <p>Ethical AI that is aligned to human values has tremendous potential to transform our society into a more sustainable, equitable, and compassionate place for everyone. My mission, in a broad sense, is to see through this transformation.</p>

  <p>My research interests to this end are broad and range from work in fundamental theoretics to immediate real-world applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My master's thesis was on <a href="https://stars.library.ucf.edu/etd2020/1054/">getting AI to understand the social factors that foster human cooperation</a>.</li>
  <li>I've analyzed the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232609">evolution of entire cultures over millennia</a> to get a better grip on how these "society" things of ours grow and change in the long-run.</li>
  <li>A project I helped lead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GASPACS">went to space</a> (though that one was just for fun).</li>
  <li>I helped create (and currently steward) <a href="https://www.p3k14c.org/">the world's most complete dataset of archaeological radiocarbon dates</a> so that we can better understand what did and didn't work for our ancestors.</li>
</ul>
