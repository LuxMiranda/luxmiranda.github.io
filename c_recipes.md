### "Plausibly Meat" Seitan

Delicious seitan with an excellent texture.

_"This is plausibly meat!" -- Noted Carnivore Ammon Hepworth_

When breaded with panko and served with golden curry sauce and broccoli over rice, this seitan is a remarkable emulation of Wagamam's "Vegatsu"

**Makes**: 1 loaf

**Ingredients**:
* 240 g (2 cups) vital wheat gluten
* 82 g (1 cup) nutritional yeast flakes
* 5 mL (1 tsp) cumin
* 15 mL (1 Tbsp) garlic powder
* 15 mL (1 Tbsp) onion powder
* 5 mL (1 tsp) smoked paprika
* 7.5 mL (1.5 tsp) sage or thyme
* 350 mL (1.5 cups) vegan broth (I recommend "Better than Bullion")
* 120 mL (0.5 cups) water
* 30 mL (2 Tbsp) ketchup
* 30 mL (2 Tbsp) Kikkoman soy sauce (there is no good substitute for Kikkoman available in most western grocery stores, just get it) 
* 30 mL (2 Tbsp) olive oil

**Directions**:
1. Preheat oven to 165°C (325°F)
2. Mix all dry ingredients in a large bowl.  
3. In a separate second bowl, combine wet ingredients and mix well.  
4. Slowly incorporate the wet mix into the dry mix into a dough  
5. Turn dough out onto a flat, sterile surface and knead for several minutes  
6. Shape dough into a loaf and wrap in aluminum foil  
7. Bake for 90 minutes directly on the oven rack, turning once halfway through baking.  
8. Let cool and enjoy! (Just kidding. Who has time to let things cool? Eat it right away!)
