### "Plausibly Meat" Seitan

Delicious seitan with an excellent texture.

_"This is plausibly meat!" -- Noted Carnivore Ammon Hepworth_

When breaded with panko and served with golden curry sauce and broccoli over rice, this seitan is a remarkable emulation of Wagamama's "Vegatsu"

**Makes**: 1 loaf

**Ingredients**:
* 240 g (2 cups) vital wheat gluten
* 82 g (1 cup) nutritional yeast flakes
* 5 mL (1 tsp) cumin
* 15 mL (1 Tbsp) garlic powder
* 15 mL (1 Tbsp) onion powder
* 5 mL (1 tsp) smoked paprika
* 7.5 mL (1.5 tsp) sage or thyme
* 350 mL (1.5 cups) vegan broth (I recommend "Better Than Bouillon")
* 120 mL (0.5 cups) water
* 30 mL (2 Tbsp) ketchup
* 30 mL (2 Tbsp) Kikkoman soy sauce (Kikkoman is seriously the best soy sauce) 
* 30 mL (2 Tbsp) olive oil

**Directions**:
1. Preheat oven to 165째C (325째F)
2. Mix all dry ingredients in a large bowl.  
3. In a separate second bowl, combine wet ingredients and mix well.  
4. Slowly incorporate the wet mix into the dry mix into a dough  
5. Turn dough out onto a flat, sterile surface and knead for several minutes  
6. Shape dough into a loaf and wrap in aluminum foil  
7. Bake for 90 minutes directly on the oven rack, turning once halfway through baking.  
8. Let cool and enjoy! (Just kidding. Who has time to let things cool? Eat it right away!)

### Dangerous Cookies

My go-to chocolate chip cookies! You're bound to receive some of these if I like you enough. They are dangerous because they only take 20 minutes to make. Please bake responsibly.

**Makes**: About 18 cookies

**Ingredients**:

* 56 g (0.25 cup) vegan butter
* 56 g (0.25 cup) promiscuous olive oil (not extra virgin)
* 85 g (0.5 cup) brown sugar
* 43 g (0.25 cup) cane sugar
* 15 mL (1 Tbsp) flax seed meal / ground flax seed
* 30 mL (2 Tbsp) water
* 10 mL (2 tsp) vanilla extract
* 180 g (1.5 cups) all-purpose flour
* 2.5 mL (0.5 tsp) baking soda
* 2 mL (0.25 tsp) salt
* 175 g (1 cup) vegan chocolate chips

**Directions**:
1. Preheat oven to 180째C (350째F)
2. Combine water and flax seed well. Then, store in a freezer or fridge. This makes a flax egg! Combining can be accomplished through whisking with a fork in a bowl or, my preferred method, shaking together in a glass jar. 
3. In a large cooking bowl, combine butter and oil until relatively homogeneous.
4. Add in the brown and cane sugar. Combine until homogeneous.
5. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
6. Remove the flax egg from its cold place. Add it to the oil and sugar bowl along with the vanilla extract. Combine until homogeneous. 
7. Combine the dry and wet ingredients until homogenous. 
8. Fold in the chocolate chips.
9. Form into cookie shapes and place onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
10. Bake for 10 minutes. They won't seem done right when they come out, but trust me; It's easy to overcook this recipe! The cookies will firm up once they're allowed to cool, leaving you with a nice fluffy but chewy texture. :) 
11. Don't eat too many!
