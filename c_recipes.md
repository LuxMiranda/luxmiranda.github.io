### Undergrad Pad Thai

Actually tasty and super cheap ramen that tastes a bit like Pad Thai but not really.

**Makes**: 1 bowl

**Ingredients**:
* 1 package soy-sauce-flavor Top Ramen instant noodles
* Frozen stir-fry vegetables
* 1 scoop "natural" peanut butter (the kind with only peanuts and salt)
* Your favorite hot sauce (optional)

**Directions**:
1. Place the dry noodles in a bowl. Add frozen veggies.  
2. Add enough water to cover the noodles without overflowing your bowl. It's okay if the veggies aren't covered.  
3. Microwave for approximately 5 minutes. You ideally want the water to boil a bit.  
4. Drain about 3/4 of the water from the bowl.  
5. Add peanut butter, about 3/5 of the flavor packet, and hot sauce.  
6. Stir until the peanut butter has become one with the ramen. Enjoy!
