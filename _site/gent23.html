    <h1>Expanding the ethics of robot identity</h1>
<p><img src="/images/robot-and-woman.png" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; object-position:top;" alt="An AI-generated image in the style of an abstract oil painting of a woman speaking with a robot." /></p>

<p><strong> Abstract </strong> - It is critical that we carry a deep understanding of the ethical and social impacts of leveraging human-like identity cues in social robots. However, relevant work which considers the ethical risk of doing so is fragmented, narrow in the stakeholders, aspects of identity, and types of risk it considers, and overwhelmingly focused on risks derived only from Western conceptions of ethics. Thus, to help guide the HRI research community to more intentional and ethical usage of human-like identity in robots and other agents, I plan to orient the next four years of my PhD studies to developing, testing, and iterating on a set of principles for this purpose. This effort shall be grounded in philosophical pluralism, sensitive to the complex, intersectional nature of human identity, and contextualize the issue as it relates to social and existential risks. Through this contribution, I hope to help empower HRI researchers with a greater knowledge of how to avoid harm and bring about justice and compassion in their work.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When designing robots for society and not strictly vice versa <span class="citation" data-cites="sabanovic_robots_2010">(Šabanović 2010)</span>, it is critical that we develop a deep understanding of how our creations will impact the societies in which we introduce them. While the potential for positive social impact by intentionally leveraging human-like identity cues in robots is apparent <span class="citation" data-cites="winkle_boosting_2021">(Winkle, Melsión, et al. 2021)</span>, the ethical waters of doing so may often run murky, especially when it comes to using identity cues of marginalized or vulnerable peoples <span class="citation" data-cites="winkle_flexibility_2021">(Winkle, Jackson, et al. 2021)</span>. Existing literature considers the ethics of many individual facets of human-like robot identity (e.g. gender <span class="citation" data-cites="bryant_why_2020">(Bryant, Borenstein, and Howard 2020)</span>, race <span class="citation" data-cites="sparrow_robotics_2020 bartneck_robots_2018">(Sparrow 2020; Bartneck et al. 2018)</span>, voice <span class="citation" data-cites="li_robotic_2022">(Li and Lai 2022)</span>). But, there is a lack of full consideration for the intersectional nature of human identity and the inherent complexities that arise when attempting to replicate it in robots.</p>
<p>Furthermore, existing works tend to be narrow in their consideration of stakeholders (e.g., considering only the user or a particular demographic group), and they are overwhelmingly focused on ethical risks using only Western conceptions of ethics. Given the global, cross-cultural reach of social robotics, it is prudent to adopt a philosophically pluralistic conception of ethical risk <span class="citation" data-cites="bardzell_feminist_2010 zhi-xuan_ai_2020">(Bardzell 2010; Zhi-Xuan 2020)</span> focused on multiple intersections of robot and user identity, stakeholders <span class="citation" data-cites="winfield_ieee_2021 milano_recommender_2020">(Winfield et al. 2021; Milano, Taddeo, and Floridi 2020)</span>, levels of social abstraction <span class="citation" data-cites="milano_recommender_2020 morley_ethics_2020">(Milano, Taddeo, and Floridi 2020; Morley et al. 2020)</span>, time horizons <span class="citation" data-cites="milano_recommender_2020">(Milano, Taddeo, and Floridi 2020)</span>, and the ethics of processes such as participatory design <span class="citation" data-cites="kelly_towards_2019 spiel_micro-ethics_2018">(Kelly 2019; Spiel et al. 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>I have just begun my doctoral studies, and is towards this problem that I will direct my work throughout the next four years of my programme. To start, I have begun a review of how robotic identity has been treated in existing HRI literature. The goal of this is to understand the current state of how the community thinks about robot (and human) identity, discover gaps, and elaborate on ethical shortcomings. Then, I plan to use this understanding to develop a set of principles and reflexive questions to help HRI researchers be more intentional about working with identity. I will then evaluate these guidelines through analyzing prior work and informing new work, culminating in putting the guidelines to the test in a user study, placing theory into practice.</p>
<p>It is my hope that, through this contribution, HRI researchers will be able to be more conscientious in creating human-like robots, broaden their research to more diverse users, more confidently weigh social benefit against ethical risk, and more effectively preempt unethical consequences pertaining to the usage of identity.</p>
<h2 id="diverse-conceptions-of-ethical-risk">Diverse conceptions of ethical risk</h2>
<p>A central idea to this effort is philosophical pluralism. In outlining their agenda for feminist HCI, Bardzell <span class="citation" data-cites="bardzell_feminist_2010">(Bardzell 2010)</span> advocates for epistemic pluralism incorporating non-Western perspectives into design in order to avoid unintended consequences borne of Western ethnocentrism. With specific regard to creating ethical AI, Xuan <span class="citation" data-cites="zhi-xuan_ai_2020">(Zhi-Xuan 2020)</span> identifies four concrete reasons for adopting a philosophically pluralist design perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using only the ethics familiar to Western-educated elites excludes vast swathes of human thought of crucial relevance to developing ethical AI</p></li>
<li><p>Ethically plural AI are more robust to situations of moral uncertainty</p></li>
<li><p>It is politically pragmatic, in that such AI can benefit disparate political actors</p></li>
<li><p>It respects the equality, autonomy, and diverse moral values of different people</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I also argue that it would help provide cross-cultural robustness. That is, a robot designed incorporating ethics sourced from multiple different cultures is more likely to remain ethical across different cultural contexts. All of this is especially important given the prevalence of social robotics research in non-Western nations.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The first step in this effort is to understand how identity is treated in the existing HRI literature. I have begun a review of papers in HRI concerned with both “robot” and “user” identity. That is, papers which are concerned with (a) user/participant ascription of human-like attributes to robots (e.g. gender, race) and/or (b) roboticist intent to influence such ascriptions, as well as papers concerned with user (self-)ascription of these same attributes.</p>
<p>After identifying the specific ways in which the community’s current understanding and treatment of identity can be guided, I shall ground this guidance through diverse philosophical perspectives on social robotics (e.g. Buddhist <span class="citation" data-cites="hongladarom_ethics_2020">(Hongladarom 2020)</span>, Confucian <span class="citation" data-cites="kim_robots_2021">(Kim et al. 2021)</span>, Islamic <span class="citation" data-cites="alemi_social_2020">(Alemi et al. 2020)</span>, indigenous Australian <span class="citation" data-cites="abdilla_fcj-209_2017">(Abdilla and Fitch 2017)</span>), in addition to ethical considerations from Western works.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the developed guidelines shall incorporate insights from the ethics of processes such participatory design <span class="citation" data-cites="kelly_towards_2019">(Kelly 2019)</span>, which may draw inspiration from the rich body of literature in anthropology on the ethics of participant observation <span class="citation" data-cites="musante_dewalt_participant_2010">(Musante (DeWalt) and DeWalt 2010)</span>, a related practice.</p>
<p>Through the lens of these perspectives, ethical risk shall be assessed in a comprehensive manner considering the entire space of impact. Recent ethical reviews have identified multiple stakeholders <span class="citation" data-cites="winfield_ieee_2021 milano_recommender_2020">(Winfield et al. 2021; Milano, Taddeo, and Floridi 2020)</span>, levels of social abstraction <span class="citation" data-cites="milano_recommender_2020 morley_ethics_2020">(Milano, Taddeo, and Floridi 2020; Morley et al. 2020)</span>, and time horizons <span class="citation" data-cites="milano_recommender_2020">(Milano, Taddeo, and Floridi 2020)</span> as axes of analysis.</p>
<p>Comprehensive ethical risk assessment must consider not only the user, but all stakeholders in the system. For example: users, those whose identities are being robotically recreated, designers, teachers, peers, etc. Complementary to the stakeholder analysis, comprehensive assessment shall consider ethical risks at multiple levels of social abstraction for each stakeholder. Morley et al. <span class="citation" data-cites="morley_ethics_2020">(Morley et al. 2020)</span> accomplish a reasonably thorough ethical review through analyzing six levels of abstraction: individual, interpersonal, group, institutional, sectoral, and societal.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is important to consider not only immediate but also long-term ethical risks—including existential risks <span class="citation" data-cites="bostrom_superintelligence_2017">(Bostrom 2017)</span>. While most extant literature identifies ethical risk across at least more than one time horizon, it can be beneficial to include it as a specific dimension of analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="milano_recommender_2020">(Milano, Taddeo, and Floridi 2020)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="existential-risks">Existential risks</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important ethical risk to consider is existential risk. Under the increasingly looming possibility of eventual artificial general intelligence, the study of aligning AI to human values is a growing philosophical field <span class="citation" data-cites="bostrom_superintelligence_2017 zhi-xuan_ai_2020">(Bostrom 2017; Zhi-Xuan 2020)</span>. Social robotics is not exempt from the need to face these considerations <span class="citation" data-cites="zhi-xuan_ai_2020">(Zhi-Xuan 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>One way in which social agents may me misaligned, and indeed are often misaligned today, is in the reproduction and reinforcement of problematic social biases. For example, West et al.’s 2019 UNESCO report identified how some female-gendered social agents propagated harmful stereotypes about the docility of women when they were not programmed to respond appropriately to abusive treatment from users <span class="citation" data-cites="west_id_2019">(West, Kraut, and Ei Chew 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>In this vein, existential risks which affect a particular identity of people should not be ignored. Design decisions, particularly those at scale, which causes detriment for a particular social group must be met with a gravity equal to as if it were a detriment to us all. Irresponsible treatment of robotic and artificial identity is undoubtedly a manner in which this occurs <span class="citation" data-cites="west_id_2019 dignazio_data_2020">(West, Kraut, and Ei Chew 2019; D’Ignazio and Klein 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that I shall incorporate alignment thought into this project. It is important to note that not all is dour; Even here there is room to develop thought in positive ways of addressing existential risk. Developing more complete identity ethics in the context of HRI may reinforce the idea of social robots not as panaceae but as precision tools with specific use-cases, encouraging our fellow researchers to reconsider applications where robots are unnecessary. This leads to less usage of energy and climate-intensive materials such as lithium, and allows for the reallocation of funds to more effective causes. <span class="citation" data-cites="hambuchen_review_2021">(Hambuchen, Marquez, and Fong 2021)</span>.</p>
